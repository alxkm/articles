## Multithreaded programming anti-patterns in Java Pt.1

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*7lRgPlBEM5D1XfMoWdE7CQ.jpeg)

Multithreaded programming in Java is a potent tool for enhancing performance and responsiveness in applications. However, it comes with a myriad of potential pitfalls and antipatterns that can introduce bugs, inefficiencies, and maintenance challenges. Understanding these antipatterns is as crucial as mastering the patterns that promote effective multithreading. In this article, we will delve into some of the most prevalent multithreading antipatterns, exploring their implications and the strategies for avoiding them. By being aware of these common antipatterns, developers can write more robust, efficient, and maintainable concurrent code. Letâ€™s take a closer look at these antipatterns and understand how to address them:

**Thread Leakage**

* **Description**: Threads are created but never terminated, leading to resource exhaustion.

* **Solution**: Use thread pools (e.g., **ThreadPoolExecutor**) to manage threads.

**Busy Waiting**

* **Description**: A thread repeatedly checks a condition in a loop, wasting CPU cycles.

* **Solution**: Use wait/notify mechanisms or higher-level concurrency constructs like **CountDownLatch**, **CyclicBarrier**, or **Condition**.

**Nested Monitor Lockout (Deadlock)**

* **Description**: Two or more threads block each other by holding resources the other needs.

* **Solution**: Always acquire multiple locks in a consistent global order, use **tryLock **with timeouts, or avoid acquiring multiple locks if possible.

**Forgotten Synchronization**

* **Description**: Access to shared resources is not properly synchronized, leading to race conditions.

* **Solution**: Use synchronized blocks or higher-level concurrency utilities (e.g., **ReentrantLock, Atomic*** classes).

**Excessive Synchronization**

* **Description**: Overuse of synchronization, leading to contention and reduced parallelism.

* **Solution**: Minimize the scope of synchronized blocks, use lock-free algorithms, or utilize concurrent collections (e.g., **ConcurrentHashMap**, **CopyOnWriteArrayList**).

**Using Thread-Safe Collections Incorrectly**

* **Description**: Assuming individual thread-safe operations guarantee overall thread-safe logic.

* **Solution**: Combine operations using explicit locks or use higher-level synchronization constructs to maintain logical thread safety.

**Ignoring InterruptedException**

* **Description**: Swallowing or ignoring the **InterruptedException**, leading to threads that cannot be properly managed or interrupted.

* **Solution**: Handle interruptions properly, typically by cleaning up and propagating the interruption status.

**Starting a Thread in a Constructor**

* **Description**: Starting a thread from within a constructor, possibly before the object is fully constructed.

* **Solution**: Start threads from a dedicated method called after construction, or use factory methods.

## Thread Leakage

**Thread leakage** occurs when a program unintentionally fails to release or terminate threads that are no longer needed, causing them to continue consuming system resources indefinitely. This can happen for various reasons, such as:

1. **Threads waiting indefinitely**: Threads might wait indefinitely due to improper synchronization or a missing signal.

2. **Threads blocked on I/O operations**: Threads might be blocked indefinitely waiting for I/O operations that never complete.

3. **Threads not properly terminated**: Threads might not be properly terminated, often due to inadequate error handling or termination logic.

4. **Unbounded thread creation**: Creating threads without proper limits or controls, such as in a loop that spawns new threads, can lead to thread leakage if these threads are not properly managed.

Here is an example of problem code, where we continuously creating new threads without stopping them will lead to an excessive number of threads, eventually consuming all system resources:

    import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
    import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
    
    /**
     * Demonstrates thread leakage by continuously creating and starting new threads without proper termination.
     */
    public class ThreadLeakageExample {
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            ThreadLeakageExample example = new ThreadLeakageExample();
            example.startThreads();
        }
    
        /**
         * Continuously starts new threads without properly managing their lifecycle, leading to thread leakage.
         */
        public void startThreads() {
            while (true) {
                new Thread(() -> {
                    // Simulate some work with a sleep
                    try {
                        Thread.sleep(1000);
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                    }
                }).start();
            }
        }
    }

Resolution: Using a Thread Pool to Prevent Thread Leakage

    import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
    import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
    
    /**
     * Demonstrates the resolution of thread leakage by using a thread pool to manage threads.
     */
    public class ThreadLeakageResolution {
    
        private final ExecutorService executorService;
    
        /**
         * Initializes the ThreadLeakageResolution with a fixed thread pool.
         */
        public ThreadLeakageResolution() {
            // Initialize a fixed thread pool with a fixed number of threads
            this.executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
        }
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            ThreadLeakageResolution example = new ThreadLeakageResolution();
            example.startThreads();
        }
    
        /**
         * Submits tasks to the thread pool for execution, preventing thread leakage.
         */
        public void startThreads() {
            for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) { // Submitting a fixed number of tasks for demonstration
                executorService.submit(() -> {
                    // Simulate some work with a sleep
                    try {
                        Thread.sleep(1000);
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                    }
                });
            }
    
            // Shutdown the executor service after tasks are completed
            executorService.shutdown();
        }
    }

The revised code addresses thread leakage by using an **ExecutorService **with a fixed thread pool to manage threads. This approach ensures that threads are reused and properly terminated, preventing the creation of an excessive number of threads and conserving system resources.

These examples illustrate how thread leakage can occur and how it can be resolved by using a thread pool to manage threads effectively.

## Busy Waiting

Here is demonstration a common concurrency problem known as **busy waiting**. This occurs when a thread repeatedly checks a condition in a loop without relinquishing control of the CPU. This approach can lead to inefficient CPU usage and poor performance. Here are the specific issues with this code:

    /**
     * Demonstrates busy waiting by continuously checking a condition in a loop without yielding control of the CPU.
     */
    public class BusyWaitingExample {
    
        private volatile boolean flag = false;
    
        public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
            BusyWaitingExample example = new BusyWaitingExample();
            Thread workerThread = new Thread(example::doWork);
            workerThread.start();
    
            // Simulate some work in the main thread
            Thread.sleep(2000);
            
            // Set the flag to true to signal the worker thread to proceed
            example.flag = true;
    
            workerThread.join();
        }
    
        /**
         * Continuously checks the flag in a loop, causing busy waiting.
         */
        public void doWork() {
            while (!flag) {
                // Busy wait
            }
            System.out.println("Flag is set. Proceeding with work...");
        }
    }

**Inefficient CPU Usage**:

* The **doWork **method continuously checks the **flag **variable in a tight loop without any pause or blocking mechanism. This causes the CPU to be constantly busy, wasting resources.

**Poor Performance**:

* Busy waiting consumes CPU cycles that could be used by other threads or processes, leading to overall system performance degradation.

**Scalability Issues**:

* If multiple threads use busy waiting, the application can become unresponsive, as these threads will consume a significant portion of the CPU, leaving little for other tasks.

Resolution: Using **wait()** and **notify()** to Avoid Busy Waiting

    /**
     * Demonstrates the resolution of busy waiting by using the wait() and notify() methods for thread synchronization.
     */
    public class BusyWaitingResolution {
    
        private boolean flag = false;
    
        public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
            BusyWaitingResolution example = new BusyWaitingResolution();
            Thread workerThread = new Thread(example::doWork);
            workerThread.start();
    
            // Simulate some work in the main thread
            Thread.sleep(2000);
    
            // Set the flag to true and notify the worker thread to proceed
            synchronized (example) {
                example.flag = true;
                example.notify();
            }
    
            workerThread.join();
        }
    
        /**
         * Uses the wait() method to avoid busy waiting.
         */
        public synchronized void doWork() {
            while (!flag) {
                try {
                    // Wait for the flag to be set
                    wait();
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
            }
            System.out.println("Flag is set. Proceeding with work...");
        }
    }

These examples illustrate how busy waiting can occur and how it can be resolved by using proper thread synchronization mechanisms such as **wait()** and **notify()**. It resolves the busy waiting issue by using the **wait()** and **notify()** methods for thread synchronization. This approach allows the thread to wait efficiently without consuming CPU cycles until a condition is met.

## Forgotten Synchronization Example

Forgotten synchronization is a common concurrency issue in Java where a method or block of code that should be synchronized is not, potentially leading to inconsistent data states or race conditions.

### Example Class with Forgotten Synchronization

    public class Counter {
        private int count = 0;
    
        /**
         * Increments the counter by one.
         * This method is not synchronized, leading to potential race conditions.
         */
        public void increment() {
            count++;
        }
    
        /**
         * Returns the current value of the counter.
         * This method is not synchronized, which may result in reading an inconsistent value.
         * 
         * @return the current count value.
         */
        public int getCount() {
            return count;
        }
    }

In this example, the **increment **method and the **getCount **method are not synchronized, leading to potential race conditions when accessed by multiple threads simultaneously.

### Resolution: Adding Synchronization

To resolve this issue, we need to synchronize the methods to ensure that only one thread can access these critical sections at a time.

    public class Counter {
        private int count = 0;
    
        /**
         * Increments the counter by one.
         * This method is synchronized to prevent race conditions.
         */
        public synchronized void increment() {
            count++;
        }
    
        /**
         * Returns the current value of the counter.
         * This method is synchronized to ensure consistent read operations.
         * 
         * @return the current count value.
         */
        public synchronized int getCount() {
            return count;
        }
    }

Now, both **increment **and **getCount **methods are synchronized, ensuring that updates to the **count **variable are thread-safe.

## Alternative Resolution: Using ReentrantLock

Instead of using the **synchronized **keyword, we can use **ReentrantLock **for more advanced synchronization control.

    import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
    import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;
    
    public class Counter {
        private int count = 0;
        private final Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    
        /**
         * Increments the counter by one.
         * This method uses a ReentrantLock to prevent race conditions.
         */
        public void increment() {
            lock.lock();
            try {
                count++;
            } finally {
                lock.unlock();
            }
        }
    
        /**
         * Returns the current value of the counter.
         * This method uses a ReentrantLock to ensure consistent read operations.
         * 
         * @return the current count value.
         */
        public int getCount() {
            lock.lock();
            try {
                return count;
            } finally {
                lock.unlock();
            }
        }
    }

Using **ReentrantLock **provides more flexibility and control over the synchronization process, including the ability to use tryLock, lockInterruptibly, and other features not available with the synchronized keyword.

## Conclusion

Forgetting synchronization in concurrent programming can lead to critical issues like race conditions and inconsistent states. By synchronizing methods or using advanced locking mechanisms like **ReentrantLock **, we can ensure thread-safe operations and maintain data integrity.

## Excessive Synchronization Example

Excessive synchronization occurs when synchronization is used more broadly than necessary, which can lead to reduced performance due to unnecessary blocking of threads. This can also increase the risk of deadlocks.

### Example Class with Excessive Synchronization

    public class ExcessiveSyncCounter {
        private int count = 0;
    
        /**
         * Increments the counter by one.
         * This method synchronizes the entire method, which might not be necessary.
         */
        public synchronized void increment() {
            count++;
        }
    
        /**
         * Decrements the counter by one.
         * This method synchronizes the entire method, which might not be necessary.
         */
        public synchronized void decrement() {
            count--;
        }
    
        /**
         * Returns the current value of the counter.
         * This method synchronizes the entire method, which might not be necessary.
         * 
         * @return the current count value.
         */
        public synchronized int getCount() {
            return count;
        }
    }

In this example, each method is synchronized on the entire method, potentially leading to performance bottlenecks if these methods are called frequently from different threads.

### Resolution: Minimizing Synchronization Scope

To resolve this issue, we can minimize the scope of synchronization to only the critical sections of the code, thus reducing the potential for contention.

    public class OptimizedCounter {
        private int count = 0;
    
        /**
         * Increments the counter by one.
         * Synchronization is applied only to the critical section.
         */
        public void increment() {
            synchronized (this) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    
        /**
         * Decrements the counter by one.
         * Synchronization is applied only to the critical section.
         */
        public void decrement() {
            synchronized (this) {
                count--;
            }
        }
    
        /**
         * Returns the current value of the counter.
         * Synchronization is applied only to the critical section.
         * 
         * @return the current count value.
         */
        public int getCount() {
            synchronized (this) {
                return count;
            }
        }
    }

By synchronizing only the critical sections of the methods, we reduce the contention and improve the overall performance of the class when accessed by multiple threads.

## Alternative Resolution: Using Atomic Variables

Another approach to resolving excessive synchronization is to use atomic variables, which provide thread-safe operations without explicit synchronization.

    import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;
    
    public class AtomicCounter {
        private final AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger();
    
        /**
         * Increments the counter by one.
         * This method uses AtomicInteger for thread-safe increment operation.
         */
        public void increment() {
            count.incrementAndGet();
        }
    
        /**
         * Decrements the counter by one.
         * This method uses AtomicInteger for thread-safe decrement operation.
         */
        public void decrement() {
            count.decrementAndGet();
        }
    
        /**
         * Returns the current value of the counter.
         * This method uses AtomicInteger for thread-safe read operation.
         * 
         * @return the current count value.
         */
        public int getCount() {
            return count.get();
        }
    }

Using AtomicInteger simplifies the code and ensures thread safety without the need for explicit synchronization, providing better performance in highly concurrent scenarios.

## Conclusion

Excessive synchronization can lead to performance issues and increased contention among threads. By minimizing the scope of synchronization to only the necessary critical sections or by using atomic variables, we can improve the performance and scalability of our concurrent programs.

## Using Thread-Safe Collections Incorrectly Example

Thread-safe collections in Java, such as those from the **java.util.concurrent** package, are designed to handle concurrent access. However, improper use of these collections can still lead to concurrency issues.

### Example Class with Incorrect Use of Thread-Safe Collections

    import java.util.List;
    import java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList;
    
    public class IncorrectUsage {
        private List<String> list = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();
    
        /**
         * Adds a new element to the list if it's not already present.
         * This method is not thread-safe despite using a thread-safe collection.
         * 
         * @param element the element to add to the list.
         */
        public void addIfAbsent(String element) {
            if (!list.contains(element)) {
                list.add(element);
            }
        }
    
        /**
         * Returns the size of the list.
         * 
         * @return the number of elements in the list.
         */
        public int size() {
            return list.size();
        }
    }

In this example, even though **CopyOnWriteArrayList **is thread-safe, the **addIfAbsent **method is not thread-safe because the **contains **check and the **add **operation are not atomic. This can lead to a race condition where multiple threads might add the same element simultaneously.

### Resolution: Synchronizing the Method or Using Atomic Operations

To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that the check and add operation are performed atomically. One way to do this is to synchronize the method or the critical section.

    import java.util.List;
    import java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList;
    
    public class CorrectUsage {
        private final List<String> list = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();
    
        /**
         * Adds a new element to the list if it's not already present.
         * This method is synchronized to ensure thread-safety.
         * 
         * @param element the element to add to the list.
         */
        public synchronized void addIfAbsent(String element) {
            if (!list.contains(element)) {
                list.add(element);
            }
        }
    
        /**
         * Returns the size of the list.
         * 
         * @return the number of elements in the list.
         */
        public int size() {
            return list.size();
        }
    }

By synchronizing the **addIfAbsent **method, we ensure that only one thread can execute it at a time, making the operation atomic.

## Alternative Resolution: Using ConcurrentHashMap

Another approach is to use a **ConcurrentHashMap **to achieve atomic check-and-add operations. The **ConcurrentHashMap **provides thread-safe methods that can help simplify the code.

    import java.util.Set;
    import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;
    
    public class OptimizedUsage {
        private final Set<String> set = ConcurrentHashMap.newKeySet();
    
        /**
         * Adds a new element to the set if it's not already present.
         * This method uses ConcurrentHashMap to ensure thread-safety.
         * 
         * @param element the element to add to the set.
         */
        public void addIfAbsent(String element) {
            set.add(element);
        }
    
        /**
         * Returns the size of the set.
         * 
         * @return the number of elements in the set.
         */
        public int size() {
            return set.size();
        }
    }

In this case, **ConcurrentHashMap.newKeySet()** creates a thread-safe set backed by a **ConcurrentHashMap**. The **add **method of this set is atomic, ensuring that the element is added only if it is not already present.

## Conclusion

Using thread-safe collections does not automatically make your code thread-safe. Proper usage and understanding of atomic operations are crucial to ensuring thread safety. By synchronizing methods or using appropriate concurrent collections with atomic operations, we can avoid common pitfalls and ensure the correct behavior of our concurrent programs.

## Ignoring InterruptedException Example

Ignoring InterruptedException is a common problem in Java concurrency where threads that are interrupted do not properly handle the interruption, leading to issues like thread leaks, unresponsive applications, or improper termination of tasks.

### Example Class Ignoring InterruptedException

    public class IgnoringInterruptedException implements Runnable {
        /**
         * The run method performs a long-running task.
         * It ignores InterruptedException, which is a bad practice.
         */
        @Override
        public void run() {
            while (true) {
                try {
                    // Simulating long-running task
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                    System.out.println("Working...");
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    // Ignoring the interruption, which is bad practice
                }
            }
        }
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Thread thread = new Thread(new IgnoringInterruptedException());
            thread.start();
    
            // Interrupt the thread after 3 seconds
            try {
                Thread.sleep(3000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            thread.interrupt();
        }
    }

In this example, the **run **method catches **InterruptedException **but does not handle it appropriately, simply ignoring it. This can cause the thread to continue running even when it should stop.

### Resolution: Proper Handling of InterruptedException

To resolve this issue, the thread should properly handle **InterruptedException **by either propagating the exception or breaking out of the loop.

    public class ProperlyHandlingInterruptedException implements Runnable {
        /**
         * The run method performs a long-running task.
         * It handles InterruptedException properly by restoring the interrupt status.
         */
        @Override
        public void run() {
            while (true) {
                try {
                    // Simulating long-running task
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                    System.out.println("Working...");
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    // Restore the interrupted status
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                    System.out.println("Thread was interrupted, stopping.");
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Thread thread = new Thread(new ProperlyHandlingInterruptedException());
            thread.start();
    
            // Interrupt the thread after 3 seconds
            try {
                Thread.sleep(3000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            thread.interrupt();
        }
    }

In this revised example, the **run **method handles the **InterruptedException **by restoring the interrupt status with **Thread.currentThread().interrupt()** and breaking out of the loop. This ensures that the thread stops running as intended.

## Alternative Resolution: Propagating InterruptedException

Another approach is to propagate the **InterruptedException **up the call stack, allowing higher-level methods to handle it appropriately.

    public class PropagatingInterruptedException implements Runnable {
        /**
         * The run method performs a long-running task.
         * It propagates InterruptedException by declaring it in the method signature.
         */
        @Override
        public void run() {
            try {
                while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {
                    // Simulating long-running task
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                    System.out.println("Working...");
                }
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println("Thread was interrupted, stopping.");
            }
        }
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Thread thread = new Thread(new PropagatingInterruptedException());
            thread.start();
    
            // Interrupt the thread after 3 seconds
            try {
                Thread.sleep(3000);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            thread.interrupt();
        }
    }

In this version, the loop condition checks for **Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()**, ensuring that the loop exits when the thread is interrupted. The **InterruptedException **is caught and handled by logging a message and exiting the loop.

## Conclusion

Ignoring **InterruptedException **is a bad practice that can lead to unresponsive or improperly functioning applications. Properly handling **InterruptedException **by restoring the interrupt status or propagating the exception ensures that threads can be gracefully interrupted and stopped, maintaining the application's responsiveness and stability.

## Ignoring Starting a Thread in a Constructor Example

Starting a thread within a constructor can lead to unpredictable behavior or issues where the thread starts before the object is fully constructed.

### Example Class Ignoring Thread Start in Constructor

    public class ThreadInConstructor extends Thread {
        private String message;
    
        /**
         * Constructor starts the thread immediately.
         * This is problematic as the object might not be fully constructed.
         * 
         * @param message the message to be printed by the thread.
         */
        public ThreadInConstructor(String message) {
            this.message = message;
            start(); // Starting thread in the constructor
        }
    
        /**
         * Run method prints the message.
         */
        @Override
        public void run() {
            System.out.println(message);
        }
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            new ThreadInConstructor("Thread started in constructor");
        }
    }

In this example, the **ThreadInConstructor **class starts the thread within the constructor. This can lead to issues where the thread starts before the object is fully initialized, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

### Resolution: Starting the Thread Outside the Constructor

To resolve this issue, start the thread outside the constructor, ensuring that the object is fully constructed before the thread starts.

    public class ThreadStartedOutsideConstructor extends Thread {
        private String message;
    
        /**
         * Constructor initializes the message.
         * 
         * @param message the message to be printed by the thread.
         */
        public ThreadStartedOutsideConstructor(String message) {
            this.message = message;
        }
    
        /**
         * Run method prints the message.
         */
        @Override
        public void run() {
            System.out.println(message);
        }
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            ThreadStartedOutsideConstructor thread = new ThreadStartedOutsideConstructor("Thread started outside constructor");
            thread.start(); // Starting thread outside the constructor
        }
    }

In this revised example, the thread is created in the main method after the object is fully constructed, ensuring that the thread starts at an appropriate time.

## Alternative Resolution: Using Factory Methods

Another approach is to use factory methods to create and start the thread, ensuring separation of concerns and better control over the thread lifecycle.

    public class ThreadUsingFactory {
        private String message;
    
        /**
         * Private constructor to enforce usage of factory method.
         * 
         * @param message the message to be printed by the thread.
         */
        private ThreadUsingFactory(String message) {
            this.message = message;
        }
    
        /**
         * Factory method to create and start the thread.
         * 
         * @param message the message to be printed by the thread.
         * @return the created thread.
         */
        public static ThreadUsingFactory createAndStart(String message) {
            ThreadUsingFactory thread = new ThreadUsingFactory(message);
            thread.start();
            return thread;
        }
    
        /**
         * Run method prints the message.
         */
        private void run() {
            System.out.println(message);
        }
    
        /**
         * Start method to begin thread execution.
         */
        private void start() {
            new Thread(this::run).start();
        }
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            ThreadUsingFactory.createAndStart("Thread started using factory method");
        }
    }

In this revised example, the thread is created in the main method after the object is fully constructed, ensuring that the thread starts at an appropriate time.

## Alternative Resolution: Using Factory Methods

Another approach is to use factory methods to create and start the thread, ensuring separation of concerns and better control over the thread lifecycle.

    public class ThreadUsingFactory {
        private String message;
    
        /**
         * Private constructor to enforce usage of factory method.
         * 
         * @param message the message to be printed by the thread.
         */
        private ThreadUsingFactory(String message) {
            this.message = message;
        }
    
        /**
         * Factory method to create and start the thread.
         * 
         * @param message the message to be printed by the thread.
         * @return the created thread.
         */
        public static ThreadUsingFactory createAndStart(String message) {
            ThreadUsingFactory thread = new ThreadUsingFactory(message);
            thread.start();
            return thread;
        }
    
        /**
         * Run method prints the message.
         */
        private void run() {
            System.out.println(message);
        }
    
        /**
         * Start method to begin thread execution.
         */
        private void start() {
            new Thread(this::run).start();
        }
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            ThreadUsingFactory.createAndStart("Thread started using factory method");
        }
    }

In this version, the **ThreadUsingFactory **class provides a private constructor and a factory method **createAndStart **to create and start the thread. This ensures that the thread starts at an appropriate time and provides better encapsulation of the thread creation logic.

## Conclusion

Starting a thread within a constructor can lead to unpredictable behavior or issues where the thread starts before the object is fully constructed. By starting the thread outside the constructor or using factory methods, we can ensure that threads are started at an appropriate time and avoid potential problems related to object initialization and thread lifecycle management.

## Afterwords

In this article, we explored several critical multithreading antipatterns that developers frequently encounter in Java programming:

* **Thread Leakage**: Unmanaged threads that lead to resource exhaustion.

* **Busy Waiting**: Inefficient CPU usage caused by continuously checking conditions.

* **Nested Monitor Lockout (Deadlock)**: Deadlocks resulting from improper lock acquisition order.

* **Forgotten Synchronization**: Missing synchronization leading to inconsistent data.

* **Excessive Synchronization**: Overuse of synchronization mechanisms, causing performance bottlenecks.

* **Using Thread-Safe Collections Incorrectly**: Misuse of thread-safe collections leading to unexpected behavior.

* **Ignoring InterruptedException**: Failure to handle interruptions properly, leading to unresponsive or hung threads.

* **Starting a Thread in a Constructor**: Potential race conditions and unexpected behavior when starting threads in constructors.

Understanding and addressing these antipatterns is crucial for developing robust, efficient, and maintainable multithreaded applications. By being aware of these common pitfalls and knowing how to avoid them, developers can leverage the full power of Javaâ€™s concurrency features to build high-quality software that performs well and scales effectively.

Properly managing threads and synchronization is not just about avoiding bugs and crashes; it is about writing code that runs smoothly and efficiently in real-world scenarios. As modern applications increasingly rely on concurrent processing to deliver high performance and responsiveness, mastering these techniques becomes even more essential.

Incorporating these best practices into your development process will help ensure that your multithreaded applications are reliable, efficient, and easier to maintain. Whether you are optimizing for performance, ensuring data consistency, or avoiding deadlocks and resource leaks, the principles discussed here are foundational to effective multithreading in Java.

By continuing to refine your understanding and application of these techniques, you can improve your ability to create sophisticated, high-performing applications that meet the demands of todayâ€™s complex computing environments.
